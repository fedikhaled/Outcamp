Outcamp TN is a camping website designed for users to participate in events and organizers to create and manage their own events. The front-end of the website is built using React.js and Chakra UI, offering a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The back-end is powered by Spring Boot and utilizes MongoDB as the database for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Users can browse and participate in various events such as camping trips, hackathons, and more. Organizers, with their dedicated accounts, have the ability to create events, set event details, manage participant registrations, and update event information. The website provides a comprehensive platform for users to discover and engage in exciting outdoor adventures and activities.

In addition to user and organizer roles, Outcamp TN includes an admin role with special privileges. Administrators have access to an admin interface where they can manage users, events, and ensure the smooth functioning of the platform. They can review and approve event submissions and resolve any issues as needed.

With the integration of Swagger UI, API documentation and testing are streamlined, ensuring smooth communication between the front-end, back-end, and admin components.
